put all this on camera or root node

absolute load zone:
-vector2i src
-scene there
-vector2i dest

relative load zone:
-scene here
-scene there
-vector2i offset
-vector2i[] intersections


axis movement queue:
-start pos
-start vel
-vel dir (for x axis only)

axis movement chunk:
-immediate vel
-accel
-jerk (or higher derivative)
-endpoint vel

a series of these in a queue

new pos = p+vt+at^2+aj^3+...

if 0 is between old pos and new pos:
    solve for pos and t when v=0
    0 = v+2at+3jt^2+...

    pos result becomes new starting position value
    new starting velocity is 0
    new_pos = mid_pos + new_pos(delta-mid_t)

    same for terminal velocity

Velocity = new_pos - old_pos;
MoveAndSlide();
